    <p class="speech northumberland">How doth my son and brother? Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand. Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless, so dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone, drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night and would have told him half his Troy was burnt; but Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, and I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it. This thou wouldst say: 'Your son did thus and thus; your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas;' stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds; but in the end, to stop my ear indeed, thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'</p>

    <h4 class="name northumberland">Northumberland</h4>
    <p class="speech northumberland">Why, he is dead. See what a ready tongue suspicion hath! He that but fears the thing he would not know hath, by instinct, knowledge from others' eyes that what he feared is chanced. Yet speak, Morton; tell thou thy earl his divination lies, and I will take it as a sweet disgrace and make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</p>
